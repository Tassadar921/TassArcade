## The application and logs database are separated and accessible via Adminer

### Go to http://localhost:8080 and log in with the following credentials (generally we want to go to `tassarcade_db`, which is the app's database):

| Field     | Value                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| System    | PostgreSQL                          |
| Server    | db                                  |
| Username  | superadmin                          |
| Password  | xxx                                 |
